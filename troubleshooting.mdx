This page covers common issues and their solutions. If you don't find your problem here, check the [FAQ](/faq) or report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/meganide/termpad-releases/issues).

## Installation Issues

### Security warnings on first launch

**Problem**: Windows or macOS shows a security warning when launching Termpad.

**Solution**: This is expected for apps from independent developers without expensive code-signing certificates.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    1. Click **More info** on the warning dialog
    2. Click **Run anyway**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    1. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**
    2. Click **Open Anyway** next to the Termpad message
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### App doesn't start

**Problem**: Termpad doesn't open when you click it.

**Solutions**:
1. Try running as administrator (Windows) or from Terminal (macOS/Linux)
2. Check if another instance is already running
3. Delete the settings folder and try again:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/termpad`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/termpad`
   - Linux: `~/.config/termpad`

## Git and Worktree Issues

### "Branch is already checked out" error

**Problem**: Can't create a worktree because the branch is already checked out somewhere.

**Solution**:
1. Find and delete the existing worktree for that branch
2. Or use a different branch name
3. Check `git worktree list` to see all worktrees

### Worktree creation fails

**Problem**: Error when creating a new worktree.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure your repository has at least one commit
2. Check that you have write permissions to the repository folder
3. Verify the branch name is valid (no special characters)
4. Try manually creating a worktree to see the full error:
   ```bash
   git worktree add ../test-worktree feature/test
   ```

### Changes not showing

**Problem**: Made changes but they don't appear in the file changes panel.

**Solutions**:
1. Click the refresh button to force a status update
2. Check you're in the correct worktree
3. Verify the files are inside the worktree directory
4. Wait a few seconds for the automatic refresh

### Merge conflicts

**Problem**: Conflicts when merging branches that were worked on in parallel.

**Solution**:
1. This can happen when worktrees touch the same files
2. Resolve conflicts manually or ask your AI agent to help:
   ```
   Help me resolve the merge conflicts in these files.
   Show me the conflicts and recommend which changes to keep.
   ```

## Terminal Issues

### Terminal not responding

**Problem**: Terminal appears frozen or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. Try pressing `Ctrl+C` to interrupt running processes
2. Close and reopen the terminal tab
3. Check if a process is consuming 100% CPU
4. Restart the worktree if nothing works

### Shell not detected

**Problem**: Your preferred shell doesn't appear in the options.

**Solution**: Add it as a custom shell in Settings:
1. Go to **Settings > Terminal**
2. Click **Add Custom Shell**
3. Enter the name and full path to the shell executable

### Commands not found

**Problem**: Commands like `npm`, `node`, or `python` aren't found.

**Solutions**:
1. The shell might not be loading your profile
2. Try adding the command to your PATH in the shell config
3. Use the full path to the executable
4. Check that the tool is installed in the worktree environment

### WSL not working (Windows)

**Problem**: Can't use WSL distributions in Termpad.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure WSL is properly installed: `wsl --list`
2. Update WSL to the latest version: `wsl --update`
3. Try selecting a specific distribution in settings
4. Check that the distribution has a valid shell

## Performance Issues

### Termpad is slow

**Problem**: The app feels sluggish or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. Close unused worktrees—each uses memory
2. Check system resources (CPU, RAM usage)
3. Reduce the number of parallel worktrees
4. Clear old worktrees to free disk space
5. Restart the app to clear any memory leaks

### High memory usage

**Problem**: Termpad uses a lot of RAM.

**Solutions**:
1. Each worktree with a running AI uses significant memory
2. Close worktrees you're not actively using
3. Limit the number of open terminal tabs
4. Consider upgrading your system RAM if this is a frequent issue

### Slow git operations

**Problem**: Git status, diff, and other operations are slow.

**Solutions**:
1. Large repositories take longer to scan
2. Add large folders to `.gitignore` (node_modules, build artifacts)
3. Consider using shallow clones for very large repositories
4. The issue may be with the network if accessing remote

## Notification Issues

### Notifications not appearing

**Problem**: Expected notifications don't show up.

**Solutions**:
1. Check Termpad settings to ensure notifications are enabled
2. Check your OS notification permissions for Termpad
3. If "Background only" is enabled, notifications won't show when Termpad is focused
4. Check your OS Do Not Disturb settings

### Too many notifications

**Problem**: Getting spammed with notifications.

**Solutions**:
1. Increase the cooldown period in settings
2. Enable "Background only" mode
3. Disable specific notification types you don't need

## Worktree Issues

### Worktree won't delete

**Problem**: Error when trying to delete a worktree.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure no processes are running in the worktree
2. Close all terminal tabs for that worktree first
3. Try manually removing the worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree remove path/to/worktree --force
   ```

### Lost work after worktree delete

**Problem**: Uncommitted changes were lost when deleting a worktree.

**Solution**: Unfortunately, uncommitted changes in a worktree are gone once the worktree is deleted. This cannot be recovered.

**Prevention**: Always commit and push before deleting worktrees. Termpad warns you about uncommitted changes—pay attention to these warnings.
