# Welcome to Termpad

Termpad is a desktop application that lets you run multiple AI coding agents simultaneously, each in its own isolated git worktree. No more waiting for one AI to finish before starting another.

<Info>
  Termpad is currently in **public beta** and free to download. No account required.
</Info>

## Why Termpad?

AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex are powerful, but they have a fundamental limitation: they work one task at a time. While an AI builds your login feature, you're stuck waiting instead of tackling the next task.

Termpad solves this by letting you:

- **Run multiple AI agents in parallel** — Each in its own terminal worktree
- **Isolate work with git worktrees** — No merge conflicts between worktrees
- **Track everything from one dashboard** — See which agents are running, waiting, or done
- **Review and merge changes easily** — Built-in diff viewer and git integration

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your project">
    Point Termpad to any git repository on your machine.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create worktrees">
    Spin up multiple worktrees, each with its own git worktree and terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run AI agents">
    Launch Claude Code, Gemini, or any CLI tool in each terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge and ship">
    Review changes, merge branches, and clean up worktrees when done.
  </Step>
</Steps>
