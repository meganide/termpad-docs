## Security Warnings

<Warning>
  Termpad may trigger security warnings on first launch. This is expected behavior for apps from independent developers that don't have expensive code-signing certificates.
</Warning>

The app is safe to use. You can verify the download by checking the SHA256 checksum on the releases page.
