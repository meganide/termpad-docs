description: Learn how Termpad handles your data and protects your privacy
---

**Last Updated: February 2026**

## TL;DR

Termpad is completely private. Your data stays on your computer. We don't collect analytics, track usage, or send your data anywhere. Period.

## What We Do With Your Data

### Everything Stays Local

All your data is stored on your computer in Electron's standard data directory:

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Termpad`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Termpad`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Termpad`

**What we store locally:**

- Repository paths and names
- Git branch information (whatever your git repository already has)
- Terminal session states and tab configurations
- Your preferences (theme, shell, window size, etc.)
- Code review/diff data (stored locally in the reviews folder)
- Custom scripts and terminal presets you configure

**What we DON'T store:**

- No passwords or API keys (GitHub authentication uses your local `gh` CLI)
- No terminal command history beyond the current session
- No terminal output (cleared when you close a session)

### No Analytics, No Telemetry, No Tracking

We don't use any analytics or tracking services. None. Zero. Nada.

- No Sentry, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, or similar services
- No crash reporting to external servers
- No usage statistics collection
- No error tracking services
- No performance monitoring that phones home

The console logs you might see are for debugging purposes only and never leave your machine.

### Network Requests (The Only Times We Connect)

Termpad only connects to the internet for:

1. **GitHub Integration (Optional)**
   - If you use GitHub features, we use your local `gh` CLI to fetch PR statuses and repository lists
   - We never store your GitHub credentials - authentication is handled by the GitHub CLI you've already logged into
   - All GitHub API calls go through your authenticated `gh` CLI tool
   - You can use Termpad without GitHub integration entirely

2. **Auto-Updates (Optional, On-Demand)**
   - When you manually check for updates, we check GitHub releases for new versions
   - No automatic background checks - you initiate this
   - No data is sent with update requests, just a standard release check

3. **Git Operations You Initiate**
   - When you push, pull, or fetch from your remote repositories
   - These are standard git operations you control

That's it. No other network activity.

### What We Share (Hint: Nothing)

We don't share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone because:

1. We don't collect it in the first place
2. Everything stays on your machine
3. There's no backend server to send data to

### Data You Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Delete your data**: Just delete the Termpad data folder (see paths above)
- **Export your data**: Your data is stored in plain JSON files you can read and backup
- **Clear git cache**: Built into the app (clears in-memory caching only)

### Security

- All data is stored in your OS-protected user directory
- No cloud storage or synchronization
- Terminal sessions are isolated per worktree
- GitHub authentication uses your local credentials, not managed by us

### Third-Party Services

Termpad integrates with these tools/services:

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Local tool you install and authenticate yourself
- **Git**: Your local git installation
- **electron-updater**: Only checks GitHub Releases for app updates (no tracking)
- **Node.js libraries**: Standard open-source packages for terminal handling, notifications, etc.

None of these send your data to us.

### Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how we handle data, we'll update this document and the "Last Updated" date at the top. Any material changes will be communicated through app updates.

### Questions or Concerns?

If you have questions about privacy or data handling, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/meganide/termpad-releases/issues) or reach out on [Twitter](https://x.com/Renas_Dev).

### Summary

**We collect**: Nothing

**We track**: Nothing

**We share**: Nothing

**We store remotely**: Nothing

**Your data**: Stays on your machine, always

Termpad is a tool that respects your privacy because we believe your code, your workflow, and your data are yours alone.
