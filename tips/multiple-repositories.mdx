title: Multiple Repositories
description: Working with multiple repositories in Termpad
---

Termpad supports using multiple repositories at once. While the experience isn't perfect yet, here are some tips for working across repositories (for example, a separate backend repo and frontend repo):

## Current workflow

1. Open each repository in Termpad
2. Create worktrees in each repository using matching branch names to easily track related work
3. In Claude Code, use the `/add-dir` command to add the other corresponding working directory so the AI can access both folders (similar commands likely exist for other AI CLIs)

## Running multiple services

To run multiple services from different repositories at once, create a run script for each repository. Each worktree can run its own service independently.

<Note>
**Coming soon:** A feature is being developed to make working with multiple repositories more seamless and automatic, built directly into the app.
