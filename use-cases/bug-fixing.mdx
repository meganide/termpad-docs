# Bug Fixing

Bug triage days can be frustrating—you pick up a bug, investigate, fix it, then start the next one. With Termpad, you can investigate and fix multiple bugs in parallel, dramatically speeding up your bug triage worktrees.

## The Bug Triage Problem

Traditional bug fixing is inherently sequential:

1. Read bug report
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Investigate root cause
4. Implement fix
5. Test the fix
6. Submit for review
7. Move to next bug

Each bug requires significant context-loading time. Every time you switch bugs, you lose that context.

## Parallel Bug Fixing

With Termpad, assign different bugs to different worktrees:

| Worktree | Bug | AI Task |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Worktree 1 | Login fails on mobile | Investigate and fix auth on small screens |
| Worktree 2 | Slow dashboard load | Profile and optimize query performance |
| Worktree 3 | Email not sending | Debug and fix email service integration |

Each AI investigates and fixes independently while you oversee and answer questions.

## Example: Bug Triage Day

### Setting up bug worktrees

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review your bug list">
    Identify 3-5 bugs suitable for AI assistance. Good candidates:
    - Have clear reproduction steps
    - Are isolated to specific components
    - Don't require extensive context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create worktrees for each bug">
    For each bug, create a worktree with a descriptive branch name:
    - `fix/mobile-auth-issue`
    - `fix/slow-dashboard`
    - `fix/email-service`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give each AI the bug details">
    Provide reproduction steps, expected behavior, and any relevant context:

    ```
    Bug: Login fails on mobile devices

    Reproduction:
    1. Open the app on a phone (or mobile viewport)
    2. Enter valid credentials
    3. Click Login
    4. Nothing happens, no error shown

    Expected: User should be logged in and redirected to dashboard

    Relevant files: src/components/LoginForm.tsx, src/hooks/useAuth.ts
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monitoring investigation

As the AIs work:

- They'll explore the codebase to find the issue
- They'll ask clarifying questions
- They'll propose fixes

Check each worktree periodically. When an AI has a question or proposed fix, review it.

### Reviewing fixes

Bug fixes require careful review. For each worktree:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand the root cause">
    Ask the AI to explain what was wrong and why.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the fix">
    Check the diff to ensure the fix is correct and doesn't introduce new issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test thoroughly">
    Reproduce the original bug and verify it's fixed. Check for regressions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request tests">
    If the AI didn't add tests, ask it to add regression tests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Effective Bug Fixing

### Provide good bug reports

The better the bug report, the faster the AI can fix it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ```
    Bug: Users can't upload profile pictures larger than 1MB

    Steps:
    1. Go to Settings > Profile
    2. Click "Upload photo"
    3. Select an image > 1MB
    4. Click Save

    Expected: Image uploads successfully
    Actual: Error "Upload failed" with no details

    Notes: Smaller images work fine. Server logs show
    413 Request Entity Too Large.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Poor">
    ```
    Image upload is broken. Please fix.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Start with quick wins

Begin with bugs that have clear causes:

- Typos or obvious errors
- Missing null checks
- Configuration issues
- Simple UI bugs

These build momentum and free you to focus on harder bugs.

### Isolate complex bugs

For bugs that need deep investigation:

1. Create a dedicated worktree
2. Let the AI investigate thoroughly
3. Don't rush to a fix
4. Review the analysis before any changes

### Group related bugs

If multiple bugs have the same root cause, work them together:

```
Bugs #123, #127, and #131 all relate to timezone handling.
Investigate and fix the underlying timezone conversion issue.
```

## Common Bug Types and Prompts

### UI/UX bugs

```
The dropdown menu doesn't close when clicking outside.
Find where the click-away handler should be and implement it.
```

### Performance bugs

```
The user list takes 5+ seconds to load. Profile the component
and API calls to find the bottleneck. Optimize to under 1 second.
```

### Data bugs

```
Users report seeing other users' data occasionally.
Audit all database queries in the user module for
missing user_id filters.
```

### Integration bugs

```
Stripe webhooks aren't being processed. Check the webhook
handler, verify the endpoint configuration, and add proper
logging to diagnose the issue.
```

## After the Triage Worktree

Once you've fixed several bugs:

1. **Review all PRs** — Ensure quality is consistent
2. **Run full test suite** — Check for regressions
3. **Update documentation** — If any fixes affect documented behavior
4. **Close issues** — Link PRs to issues and close them
