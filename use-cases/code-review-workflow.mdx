# Code Review Workflow

Code review is essential but time-consuming. With Termpad, you can have an AI review code in one worktree while you continue development in another.

## AI-Assisted Code Review

Instead of manually reviewing every line, delegate initial review to an AI:

- **Worktree 1**: You continue building features
- **Worktree 2**: AI reviews a pull request

The AI flags issues, suggests improvements, and identifies potential bugs. You then review the AI's findings—much faster than reviewing everything yourself.

## Setting Up Review Worktrees

### Create a review worktree

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new worktree">
    Create a worktree for the branch you want to review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give the AI review instructions">
    ```
    Review this branch against main. Check for:
    - Logic errors and bugs
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Performance issues
    - Code style inconsistencies
    - Missing error handling
    - Missing tests

    Provide a summary of findings with file:line references.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let the AI analyze">
    The AI reads through the changes and produces a report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Review the AI's findings

Once the AI completes its review:

1. Read through the findings
2. Verify legitimate issues (AI can have false positives)
3. Add comments to the PR or fix issues directly
4. Request changes or approve

## Review Prompts by Type

### Security review

```
Perform a security audit of this branch. Look for:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Exposed secrets or credentials
- Insecure data handling
- CSRF vulnerabilities

For each issue, explain the risk and how to fix it.
```

### Performance review

```
Review this code for performance issues:
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary re-renders
- Missing memoization
- Large bundle imports
- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks

Suggest specific optimizations for each issue found.
```

### Architecture review

```
Review the architecture of these changes:
- Does it follow existing patterns?
- Is the code properly organized?
- Are concerns properly separated?
- Is the API design consistent?
- Are there any coupling issues?

Suggest improvements for maintainability.
```

### Test coverage review

```
Analyze test coverage for this branch:
- What functionality is untested?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Are error paths tested?
- Is mocking done correctly?

List specific test cases that should be added.
```

## Continuous Review Workflow

For ongoing development, set up a continuous review workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Development worktree">
    Work on your feature in worktree 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit regularly">
    Make small, focused commits as you progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review worktree">
    Periodically, have worktree 2 review your latest commits:

    ```
    Review the last 3 commits. What issues do you see?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">
    Fix issues before they pile up.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This catches issues early when they're easy to fix.

## Team Code Review

Termpad can also help with reviewing teammates' code:

### Review a PR from your team

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetch the PR branch">
    ```bash
    gh pr checkout 123
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a review worktree">
    Create a worktree for that branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI initial review">
    Have the AI do an initial pass and document findings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your review">
    Review the AI's findings plus anything the AI might have missed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit review">
    Add comments to the PR with combined feedback.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Review multiple PRs

With parallel worktrees, review several PRs at once:

| Worktree | PR | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Worktree 1 | #123 - Auth refactor | AI reviewing |
| Worktree 2 | #125 - New API endpoint | AI reviewing |
| Worktree 3 | #127 - UI updates | Ready for your review |

## Tips for AI Code Review

### Be specific about what to review

Generic "review this code" prompts produce generic results. Be specific:

```
Review the error handling in src/api/. Specifically check:
- Are all errors caught?
- Are error messages user-friendly?
- Is sensitive information logged?
- Are errors properly propagated?
```

### Provide context

Tell the AI about your project's standards:

```
Our code style:
- We use early returns
- Max function length is 30 lines
- All public functions need JSDoc
- We prefer composition over inheritance

Review against these standards.
```

### Trust but verify

AI reviews are helpful but not infallible:

- **False positives**: AI may flag correct code as problematic
- **False negatives**: AI may miss issues
- **Context gaps**: AI doesn't know your business logic

Always do a final human review before merging.

### Use review findings for learning

When AI consistently finds the same issues:

1. Document the pattern in your style guide
2. Add linting rules if possible
3. Share learnings with your team
