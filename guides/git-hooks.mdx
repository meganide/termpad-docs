title: Git Hooks Support
description: How Termpad handles git hooks and Husky integration
---

Termpad supports running git hooks automatically during git operations. This includes both standard git hooks and Husky-managed hooks.

## Supported Hook Types

| Hook | When it runs | Blocking? |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **pre-commit** | Before commit | Yes - blocks commit on failure |
| **commit-msg** | During commit (message validation) | Yes - blocks commit on failure |
| **post-commit** | After commit succeeds | No - shows error but commit already succeeded |
| **pre-push** | Before push | Yes - blocks push on failure |
| **post-push** | After push succeeds | No - shows error but push already succeeded |

## How Hooks Work

### Blocking Hooks

Hooks like `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `pre-push` will prevent the operation from completing if they fail:

- **pre-commit**: Runs before creating the commit. If it fails, the commit is not created.
- **commit-msg**: Validates the commit message. If it fails, the commit is not created.
- **pre-push**: Runs before pushing to remote. If it fails, the push is cancelled.

### Non-Blocking Hooks

Hooks like `post-commit` and `post-push` run after the operation completes:

- **post-commit**: Runs after the commit is created. If it fails, an error is shown but the commit remains.
- **post-push**: Runs after the push succeeds. If it fails, an error is shown but the push is already complete.

## Husky Support

Termpad supports Husky v9+ directory structure:

- Works with `.husky/` directory
- Automatically detects and runs Husky hooks
- No additional configuration needed

<Info>
  If you're using Husky, make sure it's installed and configured in your repository. Termpad will automatically detect and run your Husky hooks.

## Common Use Cases

### Code Formatting

Run formatters like Prettier or Black before commits:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit or .git/hooks/pre-commit
npm run format
```

### Linting

Check code quality before commits:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit or .git/hooks/pre-commit
npm run lint
```

### Lint Staged Files

Run linters and formatters only on staged files:

```bash
# .husky/pre-commit or .git/hooks/pre-commit
npx lint-staged
```

### Commit Message Validation

Enforce commit message conventions:

```bash
# .husky/commit-msg or .git/hooks/commit-msg
npx commitlint --edit $1
```

### Running Tests

Run tests before pushing:

```bash
# .husky/pre-push or .git/hooks/pre-push
npm test
```
