description: Get alerted when your terminals need attention

When working with multiple terminal worktrees, you need to know when a process changes state. Termpad's notification system keeps you informed without constant context switching.

## How Notifications Work

Termpad monitors your terminal worktrees and sends desktop notifications when terminal status changes to:

- Idle (after a process finishes)
- Waiting (when input is required)
- Error (when a process encounters an error)

## Sidebar Status Indicators

In addition to desktop notifications, Termpad displays status indicators in the sidebar for all worktrees. This gives you a quick visual overview of each worktree's terminal status:

- **Starting** - Process is launching (cyan, pulsing)
- **Running** - Process is actively executing (emerald, pulsing)
- **Waiting** - Process is waiting for input (yellow)
- **Idle** - Process has finished (slate)
- **Stopped** - Process has been stopped (orange)
- **Error** - Process encountered an error (red)

The sidebar provides an at-a-glance view without requiring you to switch between worktrees or wait for notifications.

## Notification Types

### Idle notifications

Sent when a terminal process finishes and the status changes to idle. The notification shows:

- Repository and branch name
- Message: "has finished"
- Click to switch to that worktree

### Waiting notifications

Sent when a terminal is waiting for input. The notification shows:

- Repository and branch name
- Message: "is waiting for your input"
- Click to switch to that worktree

### Error notifications

Sent immediately when a terminal encounters an error. The notification shows:

- Repository and branch name
- Message: "encountered an error"
- Click to switch to that worktree

### Available options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Enable notifications | Master toggle for all notifications |
| Background only | Only notify when Termpad isn't focused |

## Background Only Mode

By default, notifications only appear when Termpad is in the background. This prevents interruption when you're actively working in the app.

To always receive notifications, disable **Background only** in settings.
