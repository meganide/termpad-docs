# Create a Worktree

Worktrees are isolated workspaces where you run AI agents. Each worktree has its own git worktree, terminal, and branch. This guide shows you how to create and manage worktrees.

## Prerequisites

- A project [added to Termpad](/guides/add-project)
- Understanding of what you want the worktree to accomplish

## Creating a New Worktree

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your project">
    Click on the project in the sidebar where you want to create a worktree.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Worktree">
    Click the **Add Worktree** button, or use the keyboard shortcut.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter a branch name">
    Type a descriptive branch name. Good naming conventions:
    - `feature/login-page`
    - `fix/null-pointer-error`
    - `refactor/api-client`
    - `experiment/new-caching`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a base branch (optional)">
    By default, new branches are based on `main`. Select a different base if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for setup">
    Termpad creates the worktree and runs your setup script. This may take a moment depending on your script.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A terminal opens automatically, ready for you to start an AI agent.

## Worktree Anatomy

Each worktree includes:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Git worktree | Isolated copy of your codebase on a separate branch |
| Main terminal | Where you run your AI agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.) |
| User terminals | Additional terminals for dev servers, tests, etc. |
| File changes | Shows uncommitted changes in this worktree |
| Diff viewer | Review changes before committing |

## Using an Existing Branch

If you want to work on a branch that already exists:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Add Worktree">
    Click the **Add Worktree** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the existing branch name">
    Type the exact name of the existing branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Termpad detects the branch exists and creates a worktree for it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If a worktree already exists for that branch, Termpad shows an error. Delete the existing worktree first, or use a different branch.
</Info>

## Worktree Workflow

A typical worktree workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create worktree">
    Create a new worktree with a clear purpose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch AI agent">
    Start Claude Code, Gemini, or your preferred tool:
    ```bash
    claude
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Give the AI a task">
    Describe what you want to build or fix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor and assist">
    Answer questions, review progress, redirect as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review changes">
    Use the diff viewer to review what the AI created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit and push">
    Stage, commit, and push your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create PR">
    Open a pull request for code review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete worktree">
    Clean up the worktree when you're done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Multiple Worktrees

Create additional worktrees to work in parallel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create more worktrees">
    Repeat the worktree creation process for each task.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch between worktrees">
    Click any worktree in the sidebar to switch to it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor status">
    The sidebar shows status indicators:
    - Active (running processes)
    - Waiting (needs input)
    - Idle (no activity)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting a Worktree

When a worktree's work is complete:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Commit your work">
    Make sure all changes are committed and pushed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Right-click the worktree">
    Open the context menu for the worktree.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete">
    Select **Delete Worktree** from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Termpad runs cleanup scripts and removes the worktree.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a worktree removes all uncommitted changes in that worktree. Always commit first!
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### One task per worktree

Keep worktrees focused on a single task. This makes:

- Progress easier to track
- Changes easier to review
- Cleanup simpler

### Use descriptive branch names

Your branch name should describe the work:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Feature | `feature/user-authentication` |
| Bug fix | `fix/login-redirect-loop` |
| Refactor | `refactor/extract-api-client` |
| Experiment | `experiment/graphql-migration` |

### Clean up finished worktrees

Don't let old worktrees accumulate. Delete them when:

- The PR is merged
- You've decided not to pursue the work
- The experiment is complete

This frees up disk space and keeps your workspace tidy.
