description: Review, stage, commit, and push changes from your worktrees

After an AI completes work, you need to review the changes before committing. This guide walks through the full review and commit workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (run `gh auth login` if not already authenticated)

## Viewing Changes

### Open the source control panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a worktree">
    Click on the worktree you want to review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the source control panel">
    The source control panel shows on the side. It lists all files with changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can also open the diff viewer by clicking the eye icon in the source control header.
</Tip>

### Understanding file status

Files are marked with their status:

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| **M** | Modified | File has changes |
| **A** | Added | New file created |
| **D** | Deleted | File removed |
| **R** | Renamed | File moved or renamed |
| **U** | Untracked | New file not yet tracked |

### View a file diff

Click any file in the source control panel to see its diff:

- **Red lines**: Removed content
- **Green lines**: Added content
- **Gray lines**: Unchanged context

## Reviewing Changes

### What to look for

When reviewing AI-generated code, check for:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Correctness">
    - Does the code do what was asked?
    - Are there logic errors?
    - Are edge cases handled?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    - Any hardcoded credentials?
    - Input validation present?
    - SQL injection possible?
    - XSS vulnerabilities?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality">
    - Does it match your code style?
    - Is it readable?
    - Are names descriptive?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Completeness">
    - Are tests included?
    - Is error handling present?
    - Documentation updated?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding inline comments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on a line">
    Click the line number where you want to comment. For multi-line comments, click a line number, hold, and drag to select multiple lines.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your comment">
    Describe what needs to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy to AI">
    Click the copy button in the header to automatically copy all comments and paste them into your AI chat. Alternatively, click the export button and feed that to the AI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Instead of fixing issues yourself, send them back to the AI. Describe what's wrong and let the AI iterate.
</Tip>

## Staging Changes

### Stage all changes

Click **Stage All** to stage everything at once.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Discarding Changes

If you don't want to keep the changes:

### Discard all changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Discard All">
    In the source control panel, click **Discard All**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm you want to discard. This cannot be undone.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Discard it">
    Click the discard icon next to the file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Commit">

## Tips

### Review frequently

Don't let changes pile up. Review after each significant AI task:

1. AI completes a piece of work
2. Review immediately
3. Commit if good, or send back for fixes
4. Continue

### Use atomic commits

Make each commit a logical unit of work:

- One feature per commit
- One bug fix per commit
- Don't mix unrelated changes
