# Review Changes

After an AI completes work, you need to review the changes before committing. This guide walks through the full review and commit workflow.

## Viewing Changes

### Open the file changes panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a worktree">
    Click on the worktree you want to review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the changes panel">
    The file changes panel shows on the side. It lists all files with changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding file status

Files are marked with their status:

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| **M** | Modified | File has changes |
| **A** | Added | New file created |
| **D** | Deleted | File removed |
| **R** | Renamed | File moved or renamed |
| **U** | Untracked | New file not yet tracked |

### View a file diff

Click any file in the changes panel to see its diff:

- **Red lines**: Removed content
- **Green lines**: Added content
- **Gray lines**: Unchanged context

## Reviewing Changes

### What to look for

When reviewing AI-generated code, check for:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Correctness">
    - Does the code do what was asked?
    - Are there logic errors?
    - Are edge cases handled?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    - Any hardcoded credentials?
    - Input validation present?
    - SQL injection possible?
    - XSS vulnerabilities?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Quality">
    - Does it match your code style?
    - Is it readable?
    - Are names descriptive?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Completeness">
    - Are tests included?
    - Is error handling present?
    - Documentation updated?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Request changes

If something needs fixing, tell the AI:

```
The login function doesn't handle the case where the user
doesn't exist. Please add a check and return an appropriate error.
```

Let the AI fix issues rather than fixing them yourself.

## Tips

### Review frequently

Don't let changes pile up. Review after each significant AI task:

1. AI completes a piece of work
2. Review immediately
3. Commit if good, or send back for fixes
4. Continue

### Use atomic commits

Make each commit a logical unit of work:

- One feature per commit
- One bug fix per commit
- Don't mix unrelated changes

### Keep the main terminal visible

While reviewing, keep the AI terminal visible. If you find issues, you can immediately ask for fixes.
