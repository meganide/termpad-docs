description: Add a git repository to Termpad for parallel development
---

This guide shows you how to add a git repository to Termpad so you can start creating parallel worktrees.

## Prerequisites

- A local git repository (clone one if you don't have it locally yet)
- Termpad installed and running

## Adding Your First Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    In the sidebar, click **Add Repository**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your repository">
    Navigate to your git repository folder and select it, or go to the **Clone** tab to clone directly from a GitHub URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project now appears in the sidebar. You'll see:

- The project name (folder name by default)
- The current branch (usually `main` or `master`)
- A status indicator showing git state

## Adding Multiple Projects

Repeat the process for each repository you want to manage. Termpad supports unlimited projects.

You can reorder projects by dragging them in the sidebar.

## Project Requirements

Termpad works with any git repository, but there are a few requirements:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Local repository | Termpad works with files on your machine |
| Git initialized | Must have a `.git` folder |
| At least one commit | Worktrees need a commit history to work |

## Cloning a Repository

If you need to clone a repository first:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using Terminal">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
    cd repo
    ```

    Then add the cloned folder to Termpad.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using GitHub CLI">
    ```bash
    gh repo clone user/repo
    cd repo
    ```

    Then add the cloned folder to Termpad.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Project Settings

After adding a project, configure its settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the project">
    Click on the project in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open settings">
    Click the gear icon next to the project name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    Set up scripts, worktree location, and other project-specific settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Setup script | Command to run when creating new worktrees |
| Run scripts | Commands for common tasks (dev server, tests, etc.) |
| Cleanup script | Command to run when deleting worktrees |
| Worktree location | Where to store worktree folders |

See [Configure Scripts](/guides/configure-scripts) for detailed script setup.

## Removing a Project

To remove a project from Termpad:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the project">
    Click on the project in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the context menu">
    Right-click the project name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Select **Remove Project** from the menu.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing a project from Termpad also removes all its worktrees. Make sure you've committed and pushed any work you want to keep.
</Warning>

The original repository folder is not deleted—only the worktrees managed by Termpad.

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository" error

Make sure you're selecting a folder that contains a `.git` directory. If the folder was recently initialized, you may need to make at least one commit first.

### Project doesn't appear after adding

Check that:

1. You selected the correct folder
2. The folder contains a valid git repository
3. Termpad has permission to read the folder

### Can't see recent commits

If the project appears but shows outdated information:

1. Right-click the project
2. Select **Refresh**

Or wait a few seconds—Termpad automatically refreshes git status periodically.
