description: Add a git repository to Termpad for parallel development
---

This guide shows you how to add a git repository to Termpad so you can start creating parallel worktrees.

## Prerequisites

You need one of the following:

- **A local git repository** — already cloned on your machine
- **A repository on your GitHub account** — requires [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed
- **A repository URL** — HTTPS or SSH URL to clone directly

## Adding Your First Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    In the sidebar, click **Add Repository**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your repository">
    Choose a tab:

    - **Local** — Browse to an existing git repository on your machine
    - **Clone Repository** — Clone from GitHub (requires GitHub CLI) or enter an HTTPS/SSH URL
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project now appears in the sidebar. You'll see:

- The project name (folder name by default)
- The current branch (usually `main` or `master`)

## Adding Multiple Projects

Repeat the process for each repository you want to manage. Termpad supports unlimited projects.

You can reorder projects by dragging them in the sidebar.

## Project Requirements

Termpad works with any git repository. The repository must have:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Git initialized | Must have a `.git` folder |
| At least one commit | Worktrees need a commit history to work |

## Cloning a Repository

Termpad can clone repositories directly—use the **Clone Repository** tab when adding a project. You can either select from your GitHub repositories (requires GitHub CLI) or enter an HTTPS/SSH URL.

Alternatively, clone via terminal first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Then add the cloned folder using the **Local** tab.

## Project Settings

After adding a project, configure its settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the project">
    Click on the project in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open settings">
    Click the gear icon next to the project name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    Set up scripts for your project. See [Configure Scripts](/guides/configure-scripts) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting a Project

To delete a project from Termpad:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right-click the project">
    Right-click the project in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete Repository">
    Select **Delete Repository** from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose delete option">
    You have two options:

    - **Remove from app only** — Keeps all files, just removes from Termpad
    - **Delete completely** — Deletes the repository and all worktrees
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If you choose to delete completely, make sure you've committed and pushed any work you want to keep. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>
