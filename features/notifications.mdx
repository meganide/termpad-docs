# Notifications

When running multiple AI agents in parallel, you need to know when one finishes or needs input. Termpad's notification system keeps you informed without constant context switching.

## How Notifications Work

Termpad monitors your terminal worktrees and sends desktop notifications when:

- An AI agent completes its task
- An AI agent is waiting for your input
- A long-running command finishes
- An error occurs

## Notification Types

### Completion notifications

Sent when an AI agent finishes working. The notification includes:

- Worktree name
- Brief summary of what happened
- Quick action to switch to that worktree

### Input required notifications

Sent when an AI is waiting for you to respond. Common triggers:

- AI asking a question
- AI requesting confirmation
- AI hitting an error and stopping

### Error notifications

Sent when something goes wrong:

- Command fails with an error
- Process crashes
- Git operation fails

## Configuring Notifications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click the gear icon to open settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Notifications">
    Find the notifications configuration section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust your preferences">
    Enable or disable notification types.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Enable notifications | Master toggle for all notifications |
| Background only | Only notify when Termpad isn't focused |
| Cooldown | Minimum time between notifications (prevents spam) |

## Background Only Mode

By default, notifications only appear when Termpad is in the background. This prevents interruption when you're actively working in the app.

To always receive notifications, disable **Background only** in settings.

## Cooldown Period

The cooldown prevents notification spam when multiple events happen quickly. Default is 8 seconds.

Adjust this in **Settings > Notifications > Cooldown**.

## Platform-Specific Behavior

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Notifications appear in the Windows Action Center. Click a notification to switch to Termpad.

    Make sure Termpad has notification permissions in Windows Settings > Notifications.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Notifications appear in Notification Center. Click to switch to the relevant worktree.

    Grant notification permissions when prompted, or enable in System Preferences > Notifications.

    Notifications use your desktop environment's notification system (libnotify).

    - Others: Depends on your notification daemon

## Focus Mode

If you need uninterrupted focus time, you can temporarily disable all notifications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the quick settings">
    Click the notification icon in the toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle focus mode">
    Click **Focus Mode** to mute notifications.

</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing

1. Check that notifications are enabled in Termpad settings
2. Check your OS notification permissions for Termpad
3. Check that "Background only" isn't preventing notifications
4. Try disabling and re-enabling notifications

### Too many notifications

1. Increase the cooldown period
2. Enable "Background only" mode
3. Disable notification types you don't need
