# Worktrees

The core feature of Termpad is the ability to run multiple AI coding agents at the same time, each working on different tasks without interfering with each other.

## The Problem with Sequential Work

Traditional AI coding workflows are sequential:

1. Give an AI a task
2. Wait for it to finish
3. Review the changes
4. Start the next task

This wastes time. While one AI builds a feature, you could be tackling two more tasks in parallel.

## How Worktrees Work

Each worktree in Termpad is a completely isolated environment:

| Component | Isolation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Git worktree | Each worktree has its own copy of the codebase |
| Terminal | Separate terminal instance per worktree |
| Branch | Each worktree works on its own branch |
| Ports | Configurable port assignments to avoid conflicts |

<Info>
  Worktrees share the same git history, but file changes are isolated until you merge.
</Info>

When you create a worktree, Termpad automatically:

1. Creates a new git branch (or uses an existing one)
2. Creates a new worktree for that branch
3. Runs your setup scripts in the new worktree
4. Opens a terminal pointed at the worktree

When you delete a worktree, Termpad:

1. Runs your cleanup scripts
2. Removes the worktree from disk
3. Deletes the branch

<Info>
  You never need to run git worktree commands yourself. Termpad handles everything.
</Info>

## Creating Worktrees

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your project">
    Click on a project in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Worktree">
    Click the **Add Worktree** button or use the keyboard shortcut.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name the branch">
    Enter a descriptive branch name like `feature/auth` or `fix/login-bug`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a base branch">
    Select which branch to branch from (usually `origin/main`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start working">
    The worktree opens with a terminal ready for your AI agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Worktree Status

The sidebar shows the status of each worktree:

- **Running** — An AI agent is actively working
- **Waiting** — The AI needs input from you
- **Idle** — No active processes

This helps you track progress across all your parallel tasks without switching contexts.

## Benefits of Worktrees

### No merge conflicts while working

Each AI agent works in its own worktree. Changes don't mix until you explicitly merge, so there's no risk of one AI overwriting another's work.

### Full file system isolation

Each worktree is a real directory with real files. This means:

- Dev servers run independently
- Build artifacts are separate
- No file locking issues

### Efficient disk usage

Git worktrees share object storage, so you're not duplicating your entire repository for each worktree. Only modified files take extra space.

## Best Practices

### Start with independent tasks

For best results, choose tasks that don't overlap:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    - Worktree 1: Build login page
    - Worktree 2: Build settings page
    - Worktree 3: Add API rate limiting

    These tasks touch different files and won't conflict.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Avoid">
    - Worktree 1: Refactor user model
    - Worktree 2: Add user preferences

    These might both modify the same files, causing merge conflicts later.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Switching Between Worktrees

Click any worktree in the sidebar to switch to it. The terminal and file changes panel update to show that worktree's state.

You can also:

- **Right-click** a worktree for more options
- Use **keyboard shortcuts** to navigate quickly
- **Drag and drop** to reorder worktrees

## Merging Work

When a worktree's task is complete:

1. Review the changes in the [diff viewer](/features/code-review)
2. Commit and push the branch
3. Create a PR (Termpad can do this with one click)
4. Delete the worktree to clean up
