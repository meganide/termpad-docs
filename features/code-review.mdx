# Code Review

Before merging AI-generated code, you need to review it. Termpad includes a built-in diff viewer that makes reviewing changes fast and intuitive.

## Opening the Diff Viewer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a worktree">
    Click on a worktree in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View changes">
    The file changes panel shows all modified files. Click any file to see the diff.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Diff View

The diff viewer shows:

- **Added lines** in green
- **Removed lines** in red
- **Modified lines** with both old (red) and new (green) versions
- **Context lines** in neutral color around changes

### File tree

The left panel shows all changed files organized by folder:

- **M** — Modified file
- **A** — Added file
- **D** — Deleted file
- **R** — Renamed file

Click any file to view its diff.

### Syntax highlighting

Diffs are syntax-highlighted based on file type, making code easier to read and review.

## Reviewing Changes

### Check for common issues

When reviewing AI-generated code, watch for:

- **Security vulnerabilities** — SQL injection, XSS, exposed secrets
- **Logic errors** — Off-by-one, null checks, edge cases
- **Code style** — Does it match your project's patterns?
- **Dependencies** — Did the AI add unnecessary packages?
- **Tests** — Are there tests for new functionality?

### Adding inline comments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on a line">
    Click the line number where you want to comment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your comment">
    Describe what needs to change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy to AI">
    Copy the comment to paste into your AI chat for fixes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Instead of fixing issues yourself, send them back to the AI. Describe what's wrong and let the AI iterate.
</Tip>

## Staging Changes

After reviewing, stage the changes you want to keep:

### Stage all changes

Click **Stage All** to stage everything at once.

### Stage individual files

Right-click a file and select **Stage** to stage just that file.

### Stage partial changes

For files where you only want some changes:

1. Open the file diff
2. Select the lines you want to keep
3. Click **Stage Selected**

## Creating Commits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stage your changes">
    Stage the files you want to commit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write a commit message">
    Enter a clear, descriptive message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit">
    Click **Commit** to create the commit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Pull Requests

Once your changes are committed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push the branch">
    Click **Push** to push your commits to the remote.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create PR">
    Click **Create PR** to open a pull request on GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review on GitHub">
    The PR opens in your browser for final review and merge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Creating PRs requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated.
</Info>

## Discarding Changes

If you don't want to keep the changes:

### Discard all changes

Click **Discard All** to revert all files to their last committed state.

### Discard specific files

Right-click a file and select **Discard Changes**.

<Warning>
  Discarding changes cannot be undone. Make sure you don't need the changes before discarding.
</Warning>

## Review Workflow Tips

### Review in batches

Don't let changes pile up. Review after each significant AI task:

1. AI completes a feature
2. Review immediately
3. Commit good changes
4. Send issues back to AI
5. Repeat

### Use multiple worktrees

Run your code review in a separate worktree:

- Worktree 1: AI writes code
- Worktree 2: You review and test

This keeps your review terminal separate from the AI's workspace.
