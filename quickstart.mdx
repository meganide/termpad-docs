description: Get up and running with Termpad in 5 minutes
---

This guide walks you through setting up your first project and running multiple AI agents in parallel.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Termpad [installed](/installation) on your machine
- A git repository you want to work with
- At least one AI coding tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)

## Step 1: Add a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Termpad">
    Launch Termpad from your applications menu or desktop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    In the sidebar, click **Add Repository**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your repository">
    Navigate to your git repository folder and select it, or go to the **Clone** tab to clone directly from a GitHub URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project now appears in the sidebar with your main branch shown.

## Step 2: Create Your First Worktree

A worktree is an isolated workspace with its own git worktree and terminals. Each worktree runs independently, so changes in one worktree don't affect others.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Worktree">
    With your project selected, click the **Add Worktree** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch">
    Enter a name for the new branch (e.g., `feature/login-page`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for setup">
    Termpad creates a new git worktree and opens a terminal worktree. If you've configured setup scripts, they run automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Launch an AI Agent

Your worktree is ready. Now launch your AI coding tool in the terminal.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash
    claude
    ```

    Give Claude a task and let it work while you create another worktree.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Gemini CLI">
    ```bash
    gemini
    ```

    Start Gemini and give it a task to work on.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other Tools">
    Run any terminal-based AI tool:

    ```bash
    # Aider
    aider

    # OpenAI Codex
    codex

    # Or any other CLI tool
    your-ai-tool
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Create More Worktrees

While your first AI is working, create additional worktrees for parallel work.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create another worktree">
    Click **Add Worktree** again and give it a different branch name (e.g., `feature/user-profile`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch another AI agent">
    In the new terminal, start another AI tool with a different task.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat as needed">
    Create as many worktrees as your machine can handle. Each runs in complete isolation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Each worktree gets its own git worktree, so there's no risk of merge conflicts between worktrees while you work.
</Info>

## Step 5: Review and Merge

When an AI finishes its task, review the changes before merging.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the diff viewer">
    Click on a worktree to see what files changed. The diff viewer is located in the top right corner of the source control header.

    Use the diff viewer to review the code and add comments on specific lines. Once you've annotated all the issues, click the copy button at the top to copy all comments automatically, then paste them into your AI agent CLI to generate fixes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage and commit">
    Use the source control panel to stage changes and create commits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a PR">
    Click the **Create PR** icon in the source control footer to open a pull request on GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up">
    Once merged, delete the worktree to remove the worktree and free up disk space.
  </Step>
</Steps>
