# Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up your first project and running multiple AI agents in parallel.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Termpad [installed](/installation) on your machine
- A git repository you want to work with
- At least one AI coding tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)

## Step 1: Add a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Termpad">
    Launch Termpad from your applications menu or desktop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    In the sidebar, click **Add Repository**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your repository">
    Navigate to your git repository folder and select it, or go to the **Clone** tab to clone directly from a GitHub URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your project now appears in the sidebar with your main branch shown.

## Step 2: Create Your First Worktree

A worktree is an isolated workspace with its own git worktree and terminals. Each worktree runs independently, so changes in one worktree don't affect others.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Worktree">
    With your project selected, click the **Add Worktree** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your branch">
    Enter a name for the new branch (e.g., `feature/login-page`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for setup">
    Termpad creates a new git worktree and opens a terminal worktree. If you've configured setup scripts, they run automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Launch an AI Agent

Your worktree is ready. Now launch your AI coding tool in the terminal.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ```bash
    claude
    ```

    Give Claude a task and let it work while you create another worktree.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Gemini CLI">
    ```bash
    gemini
    ```

    Start Gemini and give it a task to work on.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Other Tools">
    Run any terminal-based AI tool:

    ```bash
    # Aider
    aider

    # OpenAI Codex
    codex

    # Or any other CLI tool
    your-ai-tool
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Create More Worktrees

While your first AI is working, create additional worktrees for parallel work.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create another worktree">
    Click **Add Worktree** again and give it a different branch name (e.g., `feature/user-profile`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch another AI agent">
    In the new terminal, start another AI tool with a different task.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repeat as needed">
    Create as many worktrees as your machine can handle. Each runs in complete isolation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Each worktree gets its own git worktree, so there's no risk of merge conflicts between worktrees while you work.
</Info>

## Step 5: Review and Merge

When an AI finishes its task, review the changes before merging.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the diff viewer">
    Click on a worktree to see what files changed. Use the built-in diff viewer to review the code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stage and commit">
    Use the source control panel to stage changes and create commits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a PR">
    Click **Create PR** to push your branch and open a pull request on GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up">
    Once merged, delete the worktree to remove the worktree and free up disk space.
  </Step>
</Steps>
